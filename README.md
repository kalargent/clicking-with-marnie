## Abstract
The Octocat Memory Game is a challenging memory game designed to showcase my new-found React skills. To win, click each image only once! Good Luck!

## Coding Overview
The application is built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

Also notable, I used a new library, Materialize, instead of my old standby, bootstrap. 

<a name="Features"></a>
## Features 
The app has the following features: 
* Entire UI built and styled using React components.
* Displays 12 images sourced from a JSON file. 
    * Tracks which images the user clicks to determine if the image was clicked previously in the game. 
    * If the user clicks the same image a second time in the game, they are alerted, and the game resets. 
    * If the user successfully clicks all 12 images without duplication, they are alerted and the game resets. 
* Current Score and overall Top Score are calculated as the user plays the game.

## Shout Outs 
Coding is a social activity, and no one can do it alone. The following people helped me get through this homework:

* My TA's and instructor.
* My husband and peers who spent countless hours pair programming with me, answering questions, and helping me debug.
* Class resources.
* Myself. Because I keep on going without giving up.
